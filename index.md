Here is an ordered list of things that I do during my spare time.
   1. workout
   2. playing with my cats
   3. solving [Leetcode problems](https://leetcode.com/problems/)

## Introduction of myself as a programer

I took my first course about computer science when I was in high school, and that was the time I knew want to study in college. Computer and Internet are great and powerful tools for the society.

*Here is a quote that shows how powerful computers and Internet are.*
> Across the Great Wall, we can reach every corner in the world.


During my time in UCSD, I have learned more about these programing languages.
* c++
* java
* python

But just learning programing language is not enough to do well on programing. Practice is also essiential. This is why I also spend my time on Leetcode problems during my spare time. 

Everytime when I met some diffcult leetcode problems, I would usually try to find out the pattern that I might missed, and try my best to solve it by myself without looking solution. And I found out that I enjoyed solving leetcode problems, especially the hard ones. 

Therefore, I would consider myself as a programer who enjoys solving diffcult problems.
